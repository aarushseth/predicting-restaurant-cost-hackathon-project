# predicting-restaurant-cost-hackathon-project
<p>  
This is a machine learning project in which I have predicted the cost of the restaurants.
</p>
<p>
We are already given with training data and test data in a separate excel files, we will not use train_test_split.
sample_submission is the file provided by the machinehack, according to which the prediction has to be done.
cost.xlsx is the excel file which I have saved after doing the task.
</p>
<p>Hope you like the work done by me and inform me if any improvements required.
  Best Regards
